# Dialog Integration FAQ

## Overview

This FAQ addresses common questions about the keyboard-controlled dialog integration in the Voice Bot. It covers technical issues, usage patterns, and troubleshooting.

## üéØ General Questions

### Q: What is keyboard-controlled dialog integration?

**A:** Keyboard-controlled dialog integration allows you to use simple keyboard commands (`s` for start, `t` for stop) to control speech recording, with the transcribed speech being processed through an intelligent dialog system instead of just being echoed back.

### Q: How is this different from the regular voice bot?

**A:** The regular voice bot uses automatic voice activity detection (VAD) and may have issues with speech boundary detection. The keyboard-controlled version gives you precise control over when recording starts and stops, ensuring reliable processing through the dialog system.

### Q: Why should I use keyboard controls instead of automatic detection?

**A:** Keyboard controls provide:
- **Reliability**: No issues with speech boundary detection
- **Precision**: You control exactly when recording starts/stops
- **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot issues
- **Consistency**: Predictable behavior across different environments

## üéÆ Usage Questions

### Q: How do I start using keyboard-controlled dialog?

**A:** 
1. Run the bot in Manual Mode: `python voice_bot.py manual`
2. Press `s` + Enter to start recording
3. Speak your message
4. Press `t` + Enter to stop and process
5. Listen to the intelligent response

### Q: What commands are available?

**A:** 
- `s` + Enter: Start recording
- `t` + Enter: Stop recording and process
- `q` + Enter: Quit the application
- `h` + Enter: Show help

### Q: Do I need to press Enter after each command?

**A:** Yes, you must press Enter after each command. The system waits for the Enter key to process the command.

### Q: How long should I speak?

**A:** Keep your messages concise, ideally 1-10 seconds. Longer messages may have reduced accuracy, and very short messages might not be detected properly.

### Q: Can I interrupt the bot while it's speaking?

**A:** Yes, you can press `s` to start recording even while the bot is speaking. This will interrupt the current response and start a new recording.

## üîß Technical Questions

### Q: What happens when I press `t`?

**A:** When you press `t`:
1. Recording stops immediately
2. Audio is transcribed to text
3. Text is processed through the dialog system
4. An intelligent response is generated
5. Response is spoken back to you

### Q: How does the dialog system work?

**A:** The dialog system:
1. Analyzes your input for intent (greeting, question, request, etc.)
2. Generates an appropriate response based on the intent
3. Maintains conversation context across turns
4. Handles different languages (English/Hindi)

### Q: What if the dialog system fails?

**A:** If the dialog system fails, you'll receive a fallback response like "I'm sorry, I'm having trouble processing your request right now. Please try again." The system won't crash.

### Q: How does language detection work?

**A:** The system automatically detects whether you're speaking English or Hindi based on:
- Language patterns in the transcribed text
- Confidence scores for each language
- Fallback to English for mixed or unclear input

### Q: Can I use other languages?

**A:** Currently, the system supports English and Hindi. Other languages may be added in future versions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Questions

### Q: The bot transcribes but doesn't give intelligent responses

**A:** This usually means the dialog system isn't working. Check:
1. Are you using Manual Mode? (`python voice_bot.py manual`)
2. Do you see "Processing through dialog system..." message?
3. Are there any error messages in the terminal?
4. Try restarting the application

### Q: Commands don't respond when I press them

**A:** Check:
1. Are you in Manual Mode?
2. Are you pressing Enter after each command?
3. Is the bot in interactive mode (showing "Voice Bot>" prompt)?
4. Try the help command (`h` + Enter)

### Q: Recording starts but stops immediately

**A:** This indicates audio issues:
1. Check microphone permissions (macOS: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone)
2. Verify your microphone is working
3. Try a different audio device
4. Check for background noise

### Q: Transcription is inaccurate or fails

**A:** Improve transcription by:
1. Speaking closer to the microphone (6-12 inches)
2. Reducing background noise
3. Speaking clearly and at normal volume
4. Using a higher-quality microphone
5. Ensuring stable audio environment

### Q: The bot gives fallback responses instead of intelligent ones

**A:** This means the dialog system is failing:
1. Check for error messages in the terminal
2. Verify dialog system models are loaded
3. Try simpler questions first
4. Restart the application
5. Check system resources (memory, CPU)

## üåê Language Questions

### Q: How does the system detect language?

**A:** Language detection works by:
1. Analyzing the transcribed text for language patterns
2. Calculating confidence scores for English and Hindi
3. Selecting the language with the highest confidence
4. Handling mixed language input appropriately

### Q: Can I force a specific language?

**A:** Currently, language detection is automatic. You can influence it by:
- Speaking clearly in your preferred language
- Using language-specific vocabulary
- Avoiding mixed language in single utterances

### Q: What happens with mixed language input?

**A:** Mixed language input is detected and handled by:
1. Recognizing both languages in the input
2. Defaulting to English for responses
3. Acknowledging multilingual capability
4. Providing appropriate responses

### Q: Why does the bot sometimes respond in the wrong language?

**A:** This can happen due to:
1. Low confidence in language detection
2. Unclear or garbled speech
3. Background noise affecting transcription
4. System defaulting to English for safety

## üí¨ Conversation Questions

### Q: Does the bot remember previous conversations?

**A:** The bot maintains context within a single session but doesn't persist memory between sessions. Each conversation starts fresh.

### Q: Can I have multi-turn conversations?

**A:** Yes! The bot maintains context across turns within a session:
1. Each response builds on previous context
2. Follow-up questions are contextually relevant
3. Information is carried forward appropriately

### Q: How do I end a conversation?

**A:** You can:
1. Press `q` + Enter to quit the application
2. Simply stop using the bot (it will timeout after inactivity)
3. Start a new conversation by asking a different question

### Q: Can I ask the bot to do tasks?

**A:** Yes, the bot can help with various tasks:
- Answering questions
- Providing information
- Helping with planning
- Creative writing assistance
- Problem-solving support

## üîß Performance Questions

### Q: How fast should responses be?

**A:** Typical response times:
- Simple responses: < 2 seconds
- Complex responses: < 5 seconds
- If responses take longer, check system resources

### Q: Why is the bot slow sometimes?

**A:** Slow responses can be due to:
1. High system load (CPU/memory)
2. Complex dialog processing
3. Network issues (if using external services)
4. Large audio files being processed

### Q: How much memory does the bot use?

**A:** Memory usage varies:
- Light mode: 2-4GB
- Full mode: 4-8GB
- If usage exceeds 8GB, restart the application

### Q: Can I optimize performance?

**A:** Yes, by:
1. Closing unnecessary applications
2. Using high-quality audio equipment
3. Keeping messages concise
4. Restarting if memory usage is high
5. Using simple mode for basic functionality
