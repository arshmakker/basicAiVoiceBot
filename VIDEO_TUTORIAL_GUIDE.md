[SCREEN: Show help command]

NARRATOR: "Let's start by pressing 'h' and Enter to see the available commands."

[SCREEN: Show help output]

NARRATOR: "Perfect! You can see the available commands. Now let's try our first recording."

[SCREEN: Press 's' + Enter]

NARRATOR: "Press 's' and Enter to start recording. Notice the recording indicator appears."

[SCREEN: Speak "Hello"]

NARRATOR: "Now I'll speak 'Hello' into the microphone."

[SCREEN: Press 't' + Enter]

NARRATOR: "Press 't' and Enter to stop recording and process through the dialog system."

[SCREEN: Show processing messages]

NARRATOR: "Watch as the bot transcribes the speech and processes it through the dialog system. Notice it says 'Processing through dialog system' instead of just echoing back what I said."

[SCREEN: Show intelligent response]

NARRATOR: "Excellent! The bot gave an intelligent response: 'Hello! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today?' This is the power of dialog integration."
